Thank you for downloading Firebolt!

To install, upload all files located in the Upload directory to your forum's root and import the XML. You may also wish to alter the shoutbox's settings.

I wrote this initial version in 9 hours, and yes, it probably has a bug or two. It is also very feature-less. If you have found a bug, or have a feature you'd like to see implemented, why not tell me on my vB.org thread?
